# Code Jam 1

This is the repository for all code relating to our first code jam, in March 2018. Participants should fork this repository, and submit their code in a pull request.

**This code jam runs from the 23rd of March to the 25th of March, measured using the UTC timezone.** Make sure you open your pull request by then. Once the deadline is up, stop pushing commits - we will not accept any submissions made after this date.

## How To Participate

Documentation is forthcoming. Don't worry if you haven't used Git - everything will be explained well in advance!

## The Task

There will be no details on the task available until the code jam is about to start. However, we can tell you that you will be provided with a template project to work on this month. We will also be providing automatic linting using Travis CI. This will test your pull requests only, so we recommend that you open your pull request as soon as you've pushed a commit to your project.

This month's theme is: **Snakes**.
